# (unofficial) TelefonTerror.no Android application #

This is an application for Android based mobile devices.

## Purpose ##

Its purpose is to give users on Android devices that live in Norway a 
way to identify spammers and telemarketers that try to call them. The 
identification of these unwanted people is done with the very nice 
database from telefonterror.no. 

## Database copyright ##

The author of this application has acquired permission to use the data 
for this specific purpose. If you plan to develop this codebase into 
something else that uses that database, you'll need to acquire 
permission from the rightsholder of telefonterror.no. Publishing this 
application on the Android Marketplace without consent from 
telefonterror.no is considered such an activity.
